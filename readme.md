**Description**

Certain websites access data from Application Programming Interfaces, like Google Maps for example.  In this project I accessed the Breaking Bad API for information about the popular show.  Instead of writing directly into the HTML, I "fetched" the data from the API.  

In addition, I have showcased the "hamburger menu" UI pattern.  When a user presses the menu, represented by three lines on top of eachother (like a hamburger), options cascade below. Furthermore, I have added interactivity to the menu allowing for smoother transition throughout information.

**Getting Started**

First I chose an interesting API.  With the hit show Breaking Bad in mind, I began to create my page layout. After some headway in that department I checked to see if I properly connected to the API.  Onced confirmed from the console, I finished up the HTML and CSS work. I connected all pertinent data for my website, and then placed the finishing touches on the interactivity of the website, i.e. eventlisteners, etc.

**List of Technologies**
- HTML
- CSS 
- Javascript
- The Breaking Bad API

**Contribution**

One Challenge I experienced during this project was when the Breaking Bad API stopped working.  Has anyone ever experienced that problem.  How did you go about project completion afterward?
