**Description**

Certain websites access data from Application Programming Interfaces, like Google Maps for example.  In this project I accessed the Breaking Bad API for information about the popular show.  Instead of writing directly into the HTML, I "fetched" the data from the API.  

In addition, I have showcased the "hamburger menu" UI pattern.  When a user presses the menu, represented by three lines on top of eachother (like a hamburger), options cascade below. Furthermore, I have added interactivity to the menu allowing for smoother transition throughout information.
